# Ruby-Learning Repository 🚀💎
This repository captures my journey in learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Dive into the world of Ruby programming and explore various projects as I master the language.

## Notable Project: MatrizEsparsa
Within the "MatrizEsparsa" subdirectory, you'll find an implementation of an Abstract Data Type (ADT) for manipulating sparse matrices. Sparse matrices, known for their abundance of zeroes, pose a challenge in terms of storage efficiency. The solution involves a linked list structure, where each element links to its next, omitting elements with no data. Each retained element holds its data along with row and column indices.

## Project Background
Originally part of the Algorithms and Data Structures I course at UFPel during the semester of 2023/1, this project was completed under my supervision as a monitor. While students implemented it in the C language, I've taken the initiative to reimplement it in the Ruby language, which has captivated me since the beginning of my coding journey.

Explore the intricacies of this project and witness the versatility of Ruby in solving complex problems with elegance.

Happy coding! 🌐💻
