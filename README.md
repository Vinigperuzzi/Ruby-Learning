Repository for the codes in the process of learning ruby and ruby on rails

In the subdirectory named as "MatrizEsparsa" has the code for an ADT (Abstract Type of Data) for manipulation of sparse matrix.
This kind os matrix has its own properties, but its principal feature is being composed by a large amount of zeroes. Therefore, is not wise make a whole structure of elements to contain no data. For this problem, you can make a kind of linked lists, in what each element links to its next element. Those elements who have no data, you simply do not save them, all the others has its data, row and column index.
It was the work of algorithms and data structure I from UFPel on the semester of 2023/1, in which i was the monitor. The students should implemented it in the C language, what i has done myself, but now i desired to do it in the Ruby language that impressed me so much from the very beggining.
